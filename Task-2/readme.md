Simple Image Encryption Tool

This Python script uses the Pillow library to perform basic image encryption and decryption through pixel manipulation. The tool allows users to apply simple operations to each pixel, such as swapping pixel values or performing mathematical operations, to encrypt and decrypt images.

Features:

    Encryption: The script modifies pixel values based on a simple mathematical operation or pixel value swapping.
    Decryption: The encrypted image can be decrypted back to its original form using the reverse of the applied operation.
    Image Handling: Supports color (RGB) and grayscale images.
